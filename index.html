<tr><th>Vi's Really Basic Collection of Essays By Topic</th></tr>
    <tr><td><p>I previously hosted a salon where people would gather on a monthly basis to talk about ideas. I would collect essays that
    about topics that I wanted to talk about and just wanted to hang out with people who could and would push my abilities to think through 
      really complicated concepts, i.e. transportation, scents, magic, etc.</p>
<p>Whether or not I resurrect the salon format for people to come hangout and chat is to be determined. I will begin to collect writings that I
find of interest and post them on this really basic webpage. I'm handcoding within GitHub, so all errors are mine.</p></td></tr>

    <tr> <td><p>In this collection of readings, I am tracing the idea of the commons and who is the responsible party for climate change. Additionally,
    I enjoyed thinking about the internet as a form of the commons, especially given what is happening in social media.</p></td></tr>
